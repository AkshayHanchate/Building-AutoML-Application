# Learning AutoML with Streamlit and PyCaret

This project is part of my journey to learn AutoML concepts and tools inspired by Nicholas Renotte's tutorials. The application helps users explore datasets, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build machine learning models with minimal coding.

## Features

- **Dataset Upload**: Easily upload datasets for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generate detailed profiling reports for datasets using pandas profiling.
- **Modeling**: Automatically compare models and save the best-performing model.
- **Model Download**: Download the trained model for future use.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework.
- **PyCaret**: Automated machine learning library for model building and comparison.
- **Plotly Express**: Interactive visualizations.
- **Pandas Profiling**: For generating EDA reports.

**Dependencies**
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- streamlit
- pycaret
- pandas
- pandas-profiling
- streamlit-pandas-profiling
- plotly

**Future Enhancements**
- Add support for classification tasks.
- Enhance the UI for a better user experience.
- Implement more visualizations for the EDA phase.
